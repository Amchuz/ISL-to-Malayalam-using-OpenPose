This consist of a folder named source_images3 where it holds folder for each signs.
Each sign folder should e named as the sign itself. I named it as "<signname>_index"
Imgaes in each sign folder is named as {05f.jpg}
I wanted video datasets and hence splitted each videos into 7 or 9 image dataframes.
A text file is also added to source_images3 folder which consist of image information.
Folder name
start and end frame of each video
